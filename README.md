# homepage

This readme exists so that repository doesn't look bad on Github.

## Development

Works best under Python 3.5. Uses Flask underneath.

## Google Photos

If you want to use random background image, use `get_photo_urls.py` script.

You will need a bunch of environment variables in `.env` file:

- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `PICASA_ALBUM_ID` (can be obtained via API, or probably using some other method)
